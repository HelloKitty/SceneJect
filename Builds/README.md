## How To Import Builds

# Manual
- SceneJect.Editor.dll belongs within the Editor folder in Unity.

- SceneJect.dll belongs within the Assets directory. I'd recommend you put it in a DLL or DLLs folder.

- Additionally, if you do not import the package and instead do this manually you will need the AutoFac dll located in SceneJect\libs\AutoFac for Unity

# Automatic

- Within this directory there are .unitypackage files that can import SceneJect into your project automatically for you.
