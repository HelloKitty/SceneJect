# How To Import Builds

There are two ways to import builds for SceneJect into your Unity3D application. I would recommend you follow the automatic directions as it will just import the required files into your project without much work. Although, if you prefer to handle this manually there are directions indicating what you will need to do so.

### Manual
- SceneJect.Editor.dll belongs within the Editor folder in Unity.

- SceneJect.dll belongs within the Assets directory. I'd recommend you put it in a DLL or DLLs folder.

- Additionally, you will need the AutoFac dll located in SceneJect\libs\AutoFac for Unity

### Automatic

- Within this directory there are .unitypackage files that can import SceneJect into your project automatically for you. Just launch them and let Unity take care of importing.
